# FlowmMeter
An ESP8266 based project to monitor the flow of water (or any fluid, for that matter) in a pipe using a flow sensor. Also Android app to display the info<br>
The firmware is a mess, but it works.<br>
The app is <b>incredibly</b> low effort too. The IP address for the ESP8266 is hard coded.<br>
